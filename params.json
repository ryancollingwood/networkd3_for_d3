  "body": "# networkd3_for_d3\r\nShiny visualisation built in R using networkD3 (of the D3 visualisation library) to explore a dataset relating to Diablo® III (otherwise also known as D3). Other notable packages used: plotly, shinyjs.\r\n \r\n###Diablo® III\r\nDiablo is a trademark or registered trademark of Blizzard Entertainment, Inc., in the U.S. and/or other countries.\r\n\r\n###networkD3\r\nhttps://christophergandrud.github.io/networkD3/ - project page\r\n\r\n## Overview:\r\nGiven some source data in a standard tabular format, that we want to create a network (graph) visualisation of the items (Weapons, Helmet, Gloves, Boots in our Example):\r\n\r\n| Character Name  | ... | Weapon | Helmet |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| Billy the Wizard  | ...  | Wand of Zapping | Wizard's Hat |\r\n| Conan the Barbarian | ... | Sword of Smashing | Dented Helmet |\r\n| Sally the Crusader  | ...  | Flail of Flailing | Dented Helmet |\r\n\r\nBut needs to be transposed (pivot the column and rows) into format that we can work with in a graph:\r\n\r\n| Character Name | ... | Wand of Zapping | Wizard's Hat | Sword of Smashing |Flail of Flailing | Dented Helmet |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| Billy the Wizard | ... |  Weapon | Helmet | | | |\r\n| Conan the Barbarian | ... | | | Weapon | | Helmet |\r\n| Sally the Crusader  | ... | | | | Weapon | Helmet |\r\n\r\nAnd then further reshaped into:\r\n\r\n| Start Node | End Node | Occurances |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| Wand of Zapping | Wizard's Hat | 1 |\r\n| Dented Helmet | Sword of Smashing | 1 |\r\n| Dented Helmet | Flail of Flailing | 1 |\r\n\r\nWhich be used to generate a network graph along the lines of:\r\n```\r\n(Wand of Zapping)--(Wizard's Hat)\r\n(Sword of Smashing)--(Dented Helmet)--(Flail of Flailing)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Video Demonstration\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnJ1eaFifB8\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n### Distributions\r\n![](https://github.com/ryancollingwood/networkd3_for_d3/blob/master/images/Distributions.png?raw=true)\r\nExplore the distribution of the data\r\n\r\n### Network\r\n![](https://github.com/ryancollingwood/networkd3_for_d3/blob/master/images/Network.png?raw=true)\r\nCreate a network (graph) visualisation of the data. \r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/ryancollingwood/networkd3_for_d3/blob/master/images/Correlation.png?raw=true)\r\nFind out which items are frequently (or in-frequently) used together\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/ryancollingwood/networkd3_for_d3/blob/master/images/Comparison.png?raw=true)\r\nClick on an intersection on the correlation matrix and see the details of the two items\r\n\r\n## Installation instructions\r\n\r\nDeveloped and tested in RStudio Version 0.99.896\r\n\r\nThe following packages will need to be installed:\r\n```R\r\ninstall.packages(ggplot2)\r\ninstall.packages(scales)\r\ninstall.packages(RColorBrewer)\r\ninstall.packages(networkD3)\r\ninstall.packages(igraph)\r\ninstall.packages(reshape2)\r\ninstall.packages(plyr)\r\ninstall.packages(dplyr)\r\ninstall.packages(shiny)\r\ninstall.packages(shinyjs)\r\ninstall.packages(plotly)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usuage\r\n\r\nOnce you've got your Shiny webapp up and running the client ui is presented in two tabs:\r\n* Distributions - For exploring the distribution of the data\r\n* Networks - For exploring the network, and a correlation matrix of node in the network\r\n\r\n## TODO aka \"Things that could be better\"\r\n* Optimise the transposing of data\r\n* Handle the resizing of ui elements a bit more gracefully\r\n* Use the Blizzard API for querying item details rather than Diablohub.com\r\n* Import live data from the Blizzard API rather than using static data\r\n\r\n## Final Notes\r\n\r\nIf you find this useful, let me know. Even better if you're able to improve upon it, I'd love to hear from you. I'm by no means an expert R developer, so any pointers would be welcome.\r\n\r\n@ryancollingwood - twitter\r\nhttps://github.com/ryancollingwood - github\r\nwww.linkedin.com/in/ryancollingwood - LinkedIn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
